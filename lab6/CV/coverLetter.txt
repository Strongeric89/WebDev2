Position: <POSTION>


Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to apply for the Internship as currently advertised.

My passion is to establish a career working within the Information Technology sectors. From my studies in DIT, I have gained a lot of knowledge on Programming, Databases, Networking, and Web Development, as well as experience representing my class (class rep) and Student Ambassador for the School of Computing. I have a lot of knowledge on rising technologies and a growing passion for my area of study and I feel this passion would be beneficial to your company. To add I am CompTIA A+, Network + and Security + Certified.

I have been working with the public for many years and I have 10 years’ retail experience and returned to education as a mature student. My programming and software development skills include:  Java, Python, C, C++, SQL, ,Android, and UNIX/Linux. I am also currently an assistant instructor for Code First Girls in which I assist the teaching of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery. This all involving Git and various version control and design methodologies. Having recently participated in Google’s Hashcode tournament I am confident I perform well within group project work under strict deadlines .

I am particularly attracted to your internship programme. I am keen to be part of a leading IT company that offers such future prospects including training in leading telecommunications, Networking technologies and cloud based technologies. I believe this is the future of technology.

Please find attached a copy of my CV for your review.  I am confident that my personal attributes and work experience would be of great benefit to <COMPANY NAME>. I am available for interview at your convenience and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully

Eric Strong
